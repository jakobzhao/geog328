Web-based Geographic Information Systems (Web GIS) combine web, mobile technology, and GIS. It's a growing field in academia and industry, expanding GIS capabilities from local servers to the cloud. This makes online maps and geospatial data more accessible to fields like geography, transportation, and oceanography. The integration of web and GIS has led to advancements like smart cities, location-based services, and pandemic dashboards. This course teaches students to manage web GIS projects, use the latest geospatial cloud technologies, and provides real-world case studies.

**This course will explore using ChatGPT to assist in Web GIS development.** ChatGPT can simplify development, enhance productivity, and reduce the learning curve with its natural language interface. It helps with error analysis, data analysis, and producing GeoJson data for story maps, making web GIS applications more engaging. ChatGPT's user recommendations can personalize and improve the user experience. However, ChatGPT is not flawless—it may produce errors or reflect biases, so students are expected to critically evaluate and verify its outputs.

All Web GIS applications in the course can be used on both Windows and Mac OSX, with all required software being open-source or free. The course includes lectures and lab exercises. Lectures cover Web GIS theories like web architecture, front-end coding, responsive design, and web-based spatial analyses. Labs provide hands-on practice in web programming and web GIS development.

## Weekly Schedule

To get started, you need to [Gear up the working environment](gearup.md). ***Over this quarter, you are expected to read all the assigned reading materials by the end of the Wednesday of each week and complete the lab assignment and quiz by the due day***.


### Week 1: Intro to Web GIS

<!-- Sept 29 -->

The lecture sessions in this week introduces you to the fundamentals of Web GIS. Over this quarter, you will frequently use GitHub for synchronizing course material and managing Web GIS project. So, in Lab 1, you will learn to manage a web-based project using GitHub.

-   **Readings:** 
    - [Intro to Web GIS](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1782876/files/folder/assets?preview=128993703)
    - [Git Handbook `Optional`](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/). Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used for open source and commercial software development. With Git, Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone.
    - [Mastering Markdown `Optional`](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

### Week 2: Web Fundamentals

<!-- Oct 6 -->

Today, almost everyone has used the Internet. To develop Web applications by yourselves, you need to dive into some fundamental concepts. So, in this week, you will learn the basics of the web environment, its mechanics and standards. To maximize your learning outcome, we encourage you to read over the reading materials before the lectures. To test how well you are familiar with the materials and the lecture content, you are required to complete the Quiz 1 all by yourself before the due day.

### Week 3: Front-end Coding: HTML and CSS

<!-- Oct 13 -->

To build websites, you should know about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML is the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage, CSS is used to style the web page, and JavaScript takes the charge of the behaviors of the Web. We will spend two weeks to focus on these three primary coding languages of the Web. This week mainly introduces you to HTML and CSS. To evaluate your learning outcomes, we offered a quiz and a lab for your practice.

-   **Readings:** 
    - [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML). This document sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax, looking at applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a webpage. *The section on "Debugging HTML" and the two following assessments are not required.* 
    - [Multimedia and embedding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding) This document explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages. *The section on the assessment is not required.* 
    - [CSS First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
    - [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors) In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style. In this article and its sub-articles we'll run through the different types in great detail, seeing how they work.
    - [Introduction to CSS layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Introduction) This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous modules, such as different display values, as well as introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering throughout this module.
    - `To grasp the gist of the reading material, you can refer to the` [study questions](modules/module03/readme.md) `of this week.`
-   [Lecture Slides](modules/module03/module03.pdf)
-   **Thinkpiece 2:** [Responsive Design with ChatGPT](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1782876/discussion_topics/9431502) 
-   **Lab 2:** [Responsive web page design](labs/lab02) 


### Week 4: Front-end Coding: Javascript and GeoJSON

In this week, we will focus on learning JavaScript. Also, for web applications, geographical data are stored in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, or namely GeoJSON. This week will introduce you to the general format of GeoJSON, demonstrate how to asynchronously load GeoJSON data to your Web GIS application. Similar to the previous week, we offer a quiz on JavaScript and a new lab on how to load, parse and map GeoJSON data on the web.

<!-- Oct 20 -->

-   **Readings:** 
    - [JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps). In this document,we first answer some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through your first practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we discuss some key building blocks in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.

    - [Javascript Building Blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks). In this document, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.


    - [Working with JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON). JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa). You'll come across it quite often, so in this article we give you all you need to work with JSON using JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON.
    
    - [Making asynchronous programming easier with async and await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) More recent additions to the JavaScript language are async functions and the await keyword, added in ECMAScript 2017. These features basically act as syntactic sugar on top of promises, making asynchronous code easier to write and to read afterwards. They make async code look more like old-school synchronous code, so they're well worth learning. This article gives you what you need to know.
    
    - [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format. In addition, a notable offspring of GeoJSON is TopoJSON, an extension of GeoJSON that encodes geospatial topology and that typically provides smaller file sizes.
    - `To grasp the gist of the reading material, you can refer to the` [study questions](modules/module04/readme.md) `of this week.`

-  [Lecture Slides](modules/module04/module04.pdf) 

-  **Quiz 2:** [Front-end Coding Basics](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1782876/quizzes/2153710)
-  **Lab 3:** [Asynchronous GeoJSON data loading and visualization](labs/lab03)


### Week 5: Geospatial Web Server

In this week, we will focus on geospatial web servers. A geospatial web server plays a significant role in maintaining web based geospatial application. It stays in the cloud and provides multiple services relevant to geospatial data, such as geospatial data indexing, data format conversation, reprojection, and even spatial analyses. In this week, two geospatial web servers are introduced, including Mapbox (Proprietary) and GeoServer (Open Source).

### Week 7 : Geocoding on the Web

Starting from this week to the last week, we will dive into a series of lectures on web-based spatial analysis. In this week, we will introduce you to web-based geocoding using MapBox Geocoding API. The Mapbox Geocoding API allows you to make forward geocoding, which means that a text query like University of Washington gets turned into longitude and latitude coordinates. But sometimes it's not enough to find query results. Often, you want the geocoder to find query results that are biased toward a location, limited to a specific area, or both.

### Week 10 : Project Development and Presentations

<!--  Dec 1  -->

There will be no lecture on Tuesday, so we try to give you enough time to help you finish your collective final project with your team members. What's more, we will hold our final project presentation on Wednesday during the lab session this week.

**Final Project Submission**：needs to be delivered to Canvas by the next Monday, March 17th 11:59 PST.

## Course Requirement

**GitHub:** This course material will be hosted on GitHub instead of UW Canvas. On this dedicated GitHub repository, you can find most of the course material, participate in group discussions by submitting GitHub issues, and create new GitHub repositories to turn in the lab deliverables. By the end of this quarter, you will be more proficient in operating a cloud-based coding environment and able to host your work online as a way to gain public and peer attentions.

**Participation:** You should participate in the ad-hoc discussion items and complete all assigned readings and get familiar with the lab instructions before class meetings.

**Quizzes:** There will be two quizzes in this quarter. Each quiz is designed to test your comprehension of new material. Questions may include multiple choice questions, matching questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, and short answer questions.  Before you answer the questions, please read the following instructions carefully:

- **Please do not use ChatGPT or any other AI tools to answer the questions.**
- You’ll have unlimited time.
- You are welcome to use your notes, course material, and online resources, but you are asked to work alone (not in consultation with your classmates).
- You will be given only one attempt at each quiz.
- After completing the quiz, the first time, you'll see which questions you got right and wrong and get feedback on your answer selections.

**Lab Assignments:** You need to finish all four labs by the due date. You are encouraged to work on the lab assignments in groups, However, each student should submit their own work. In addition, you are encouraged to use ChatGPT to code or debug your program, but please do not use ChatGPT to create textual content that is required in your Lab Assignments. If you have any questions about the lab further, please refer to the troubleshooting section below.

**Thinkpieces:** Your weekly thinkpiece should be at least 350 words and share it on the Canvas discussion board. Your thinkpiece should delve into your utilization of AI tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or any other relevant tools in completing the lab assignment.

- While you are encouraged to use ChatGPT for coding or debugging your program, do not use ChatGPT or any other AI writing-assistant tools to draft your thinkpiece. This piece should be completed by yourself.
- Once you have posted your thinkpiece, engage with your classmates' contributions by commenting on or liking at least two of their thinkpieces. To grade your work, I will divide the students into three groups based on the number of likes and comments they receive by the end of the following week. For instance, the thinkpiece submitted in the first week will be evaluated at the conclusion of the second week. Self-generated likes and comments will not be considered in the assessment.
- Students who receive the highest number of likes and comments will be awarded 7 points, while those who secure the second-highest number will earn 6 points. The remaining students who submitted a thinkpiece will receive 5 points.
